# C_A4
/* For this assignement we were tasked with creating a program that would take in a certain number of arguments
 * and with said arguments be able to carry out the users choice of mathmatical formulas. This meant that we needed
 * to have a menu that would allow the user to interact with it multiple times and keep the original arguments. For
 * myself I created a doubly linked list where each node held the arguments data aswell as a previous and a next 
 * pointer to the next or previous argument. Overall there was alot more I would have liked to do with this but I was
 * happy with the end result. */
